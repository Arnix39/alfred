## What is Alfred?
Alfred is a self balanced two-wheels robot based around a Raspberry Pi. It can move autonomously or be remotely controlled.

## Aim of the project
This project's main goal is for me to learn (or consolidate) and apply new skills:
- ROS, OpenCV and Google Test
- C++, Rust and UML

## Tooling
[`ros_cross_compile`](https://github.com/ros-tooling/cross_compile) is used to compile the project for the Raspberry Pi.
